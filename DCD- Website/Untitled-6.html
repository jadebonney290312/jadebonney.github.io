	  <p>SA is a place where any participant can come and join our sport and embrace all that is All Star Cheer!<p>

	  
	  <p>SA: A History<p>
<p>SA was opened in July 2010 with our first ever summer camp in Sligo. Coaches Kelly and Jamie were instrumental in bringing cheer to a wider audience in Sligo. With the profit from the camps, we purchased equipment and a trailer to haul it around Sligo. The trailer was bigger than the little Suzuki Jimny that pulled it and the engine eventually gave way... <p>
<p>Soon after, we took a lease on our first premises and SA had our first home. <p>
<p>Our coaches had their first taste of representing Ireland when they coached the 2014 national squad Team Ireland at the 2014 Worlds. Once again, we represented Ireland in the 2015 Worlds and then our own athletes represented SA at the 2017, 2018 and 2019 World Championships.<p>
<p>SA became leaders in the Irish cheerleading industry. The club's policy is that enjoyment of the sport comes first, personal development is of utmost importance and the benefits of team work and discipline are among the most important tenets of life. We'd love to have you as a part of our legacy!<p>
